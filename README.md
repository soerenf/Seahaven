###### Just for educational purpose!

I am building this app with the purpose to educate users relating to possible information leaks he or she has just by using any app.
So don´t mess with the code and only use it to help people!

The main goal is to outline the course of the day of the user with an app without permissions that are classified as dangerous.
Furthermore the user is supposed to be informed with the help of notifications, what assumptions are made concerning his diffrent actions within his daily life.
This actions are saved in a database within the app and the assumptions can get verified by the user.

This verification process is needed for evaluation if the chosen approach is correct.

The database is not build to it´s end and needs more testing.
Different logged actions need to be grouped and classified as "daily actions". This is supposed to happen by different queries of the database.

Please consider that some comments might be in german and are for debugging or future implementations.
